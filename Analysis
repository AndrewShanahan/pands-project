#1: I have imported libraries that are nexessary for my analysis, I have added an alias to each
from asyncio import as_completed
from tkinter import Variable
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import mathplotlib.pyplot as plt

#2: Next I want to read CSV file as Data Frame using Pandas.
df=pd.read_CSV('IRIS.csv');

#3: Now I want to review the data by reviewing the first few records to ensure data is correct.
df.head()

#4: Additionally, I want to review the data and ensure no varriable contains a null value
info=df.info()

#5: Checking for duplicates
iris_data[iris_data.duplicated()]

#6: Now I will look to get a summary of each varriable in the Dataset such as; total count, mean, standart deviation, minimum value, maximum value
summary=df.describe()

#7: Storing the summary of each variable in the Dataset inside a text file called 'iris-summary.txt'. Creating the text file 'iris-summary.txt' with an arguemnt 'w', which means it is going to write the contents in this text file.
file = open("iris-summary.txt","w")

#7 continued: Adding the string 'Summary of each variable in the Iris Flower Data Set\n\n').
file.write(str(summary))

#7 continued: Closing the object
file.close()

#8: I now want to remove the 'Species' column from the dataframe and sort the rest of the Dataset. The reason for this is because it cannot be used for plotting.
df_without_species=df.drop(["species"], axis=1)

#8: continued: Check the new dataset
print(df_without_species)

#9: Histogram: Creating a histogram to show visual:
def save_histograms(df_arg):
    
    for column_name in df_arg.columns.values.tolist():
        counts, bins= np.histogram(df_arg[column_name])
        plt.title("Histogram of a variable "+column_name) 
        plt.hist(bins[:-1], bins, weights=counts)
        plt.savefig(column_name+'.png')
        plt.clf()

#10: Scatter plot: Creating scatter plog to display additional visual:
def print_scatterplots(df_arg):
    
    for column_name in df_arg.columns.values.tolist():
        # Since the scatter plot works in a x-y values list, it is considering column values as x values and column index as y values.
        plt.scatter(np.arange(len(df_arg[column_name])),df_arg[column_name])
        plt.title("Scatter Plot of a variable "+column_name) 
        plt.show()
        plt.clf()

#11: I'm looking to gain some insights from my analysis and want to see how the species differ.
# I will find the distribution of the species variable to check the balancing of data.
print(df['species'].value_counts())

#12:
